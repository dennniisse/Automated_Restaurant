# SandwichMaker
Priorities:
- Get environment set up ASAP to make testing easier
- Gripper added to both models 
- 



To do list:
- Implement RMRC
- GUI: has teach function for both robots and menu that allows the user to select their ingredient. Also need to have a spawn button when clicked, it'll add an object at the path of the robot (person extending arm)  
- Arduino: e-stop and tower light control
	- Green: means go, safe to use
	- Yellow: means robots are moving, approach with caution 
	- Red: there is an error
-Blender environment:
	- Add safety hardware into blender (e-stop, fire extinguisher etc.): add total of 5
- CAD
	- Find CAD models for bread, meat, vegetables, dairy and sauce bottles
- Active collision avoidance in the code 
- Separate sim: make one robot retreat from simulated safety symbol (held by the other robot) using visual servoing and RMRC
